# Data_USA
this project aims to visualize and show the total population of the United States from the years 2013-2021 in a simple table that shows the Year and Population. I used javascript, HTML, and CSS programs to achieve this and I got the data from [Data_USA](https://datausa.io/about/api/). I then used the API https://datausa.io/api/data?drilldowns=Nation&measures=Population to complete this project and what you see here.

for the HTML file Index, it has the title(s) and links to the CSS file stylesheet "style.css" as well as the javascript file "script.js". With this and a few more touches in the CSS file to make it centered and a bit more catchable to viewers and changing of color, here is the final result of my project.
